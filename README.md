## Security

`crypt3` will let you specify passwords on the command line.
This isn't very secure since command line are visible in `ps`,
but it's convenient for low-value passwords.

`crypt3` makes no effort to evaluate password strength.

`crypt3` will let you use obsolete modes of crypt(3),
even though they are totally insecure.
Only use them if you're stuck with an ancient application which cannot do better.

`crypt3` exists to interwork with applications that are already committed to crypt(3).
If you're creating a new system and need to protect passwords, consult [Cryptographic Right Answers](https://latacora.micro.blog/2018/04/03/cryptographic-right-answers.html).
